        <img src="img/james.jpeg"> My name is James and I'm someone who is just stepping into coding. My limited experience would boil down to making websites in the past, but mostly using HTML. So far this has been an interesting learning experience with skills I'd like to see myself use in the future. Outside of this you can usually find me at a buffet. My drink of choice: Soju. </img>
